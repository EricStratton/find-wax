Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?
I decided to aim for a relatively simple project so that I could ensure it’s completed and functional. I’m shooting for a simple, elegant, and fully functional app to serve as a portfolio piece. I’m not sure what it takes to make an application iOS compatible but I think it would be really good if I could achieve that goal!
